# User Guide for CSS Lab: Networks

This lab will introduce you to network analysis.
You will analyze several types of networks,
including your own social network.
The lab has three components: 1. Centrality Measures, 2. Social Networks,
and 3. Directed Networks and Social Hierarchy.

## Centrality Measures
This component shows how real-world networks can be represented abstractly as
a set of nodes connected by edges, and how this representation can be useful.
It covers measures of prominence, including:
degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.
This component also covers visualization, community structure and shortest paths.

## Social Networks
This component shows how to analyze social network by finding communities and
bridges, by measuring connectivity, and by analyzing your own social network.

## Directed Networks and Social Hierarchy
This component demonstrates analysis of a directed network of friendships among
teenagers in a high school.
It covers methods for inferring social status from reciprocated and unreciprocated
friendships.
Changes in status are analyzed over time and compared with demographics and
behaviors such as substance use.
