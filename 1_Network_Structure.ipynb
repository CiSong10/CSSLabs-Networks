    "Looking at the structure of a network takes a step back from the properties of individual nodes to identify larger-scalae patterns. This notebook explores several ways of measuring network structure. This lab will continue using a data set of group memberships from the American Revolution (Healey2013). Additionally, this lab analyzes a fictional network of complex political relationships, namely the characters in George R.R. Martin's _A Storm of Swords_ (BS2016). The _Storm of Swords_ network was created by creating links between two characters if they are mentione at the same time.\n",

    "People are often organized into groups where everyone is highly-connected: schools, workplaces, clubs, etc. What if you know the connections between individuals and want to discover the groups? This is the problem of _community detection_. There are many ways to find communities. The following cells find and visualize communities using a method that maximizes _modularity_ (CNM2004). Networks with high modularity have a high number of edges between nodes in the same community and a low number of edges across communities. One benefit of this method is that it automatically determines the best number of communities.\n",
